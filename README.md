# MNIST Autoencoder

Example of Linear Autoencoder that converts MNIST data set into more readable digits.

Probably this is senseless because the encoder is just a classifier and the encoder remembers every perfect digit that we wanna see eventually but it is interesting to see that behavior anyway

Here is examples:
First row original data, the second result of autoencoder

![Exapmpe output #1](/images/output.png?raw=true "Exapmpe output #1")

![Exapmpe output #2](/images/output.png?raw=true "Exapmpe output #2")
